		<p>Which4J is a simple utility app that helps you determine where classes are 
		being loaded from.  This can be especially helpful in debugging classpath and 
		classloader problems.

		<p>Which4J can be run in command-line mode to search your system classpath for 
		all occurrences of the specified classname. Alternatively, it can also be used 
		programmatically to search a particular ClassLoader for the first occurrence 
		of the specified classname.
