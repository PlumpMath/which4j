		<p>Which4J is a simple utility app that helps you determine where classes are 
		being loaded from.  This can be especially helpful in debugging classpath and 
		classloader problems.  It serves the same general purpose as the Unix <code>
		which</code> command except it searches your classpath (or a particular
		classloader) instead of your shell command path.

		<p>Which4J can be run in command-line mode to search your system classpath for 
		all occurrences of the specified classname. Alternatively, it can also be used 
		programmatically to search a particular ClassLoader for the first occurrence 
		of the specified classname or Class instance.
		
		<p>For more information about using this product and obtaining and building the
		source, please refer to the <a href="releasenotes.html">release notes</a>.
