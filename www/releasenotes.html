			<h3>Command line instructions</h3>
			<p>Using Which4J from the command line is easy.  Simply add which4j.jar to
			your classpath and run it.  Here are some examples:

			<p>Here we see the usage message:			
			<pre class="console">
$ java org.theshoemakers.which4j.Which4J -help
usage: java Which4J [-debug] <classname>

        The commandline version of Which4J will search the system
        classpath defined in your environment for all occurences
        of the class.  Alternatively, you can use this class
        programmatically to search the current (or any) ClassLoader.
        See the javadoc for more detail.



        Note: if the name of the jar file listed after "found in:"
        doesn't match the name of the jar listed next to "url:", then
        there is likely a "Class-Path" entry in the jar manifest
        that is causing the classloader to indirectly find the class.
			</pre>
			
			<p>In this example, we are using Which4J to find itself:
			<pre class="console">
$ java org.theshoemakers.which4j.Which4J org.theshoemakers.which4j.Which4J
found in: d:/which4j-0.1/lib/which4j.jar
     url: jar:file:/d:/which4j-0.1/lib/which4j.jar!/org/theshoemakers/which4j/Which4J.class
			</pre>
		</blockquote>

		<blockquote>
			<h3>Programmatic use</h3>
			<p>The Which4J API's make it a snap to figure out where
			the classloader is finding a particular class.  Here is
			a simple example of the api in action - please refer to 
			the <a href="api/index.html">javadoc</a> for more detail.
			
			<p>The following snippet of code shows how simple it is 
			to figure out where a particular classloader is loading
			a particular class from:
			<pre class="java">
System.out.println( 
    org.theshoemakers.which4j.Which4J.which( "java.lang.String" ) );
			</pre>
			<p>And here is the output:
			<pre class="console">
jar:file:/D:/jdk1.4.1_03/jre/lib/rt.jar!/java/lang/String.class
			</pre>

		<h2>Building</h2>
		<p>Simply grab a copy of the cvs module from the 
		<a href="https://which4j.dev.java.net/">Which4J homepage</a>
		on java.net, cd into the root directory and launch ant.  The
		build transcript should look something like this:
		
		<pre class="console">
$ ant
Buildfile: build.xml
