		<h2>User's Guide</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<h3>Programmatic use</h3>
			<p>The Which4J API's make it a snap to figure out where
			a ClassLoader is finding a particular class.  This is 
			extremely valuable when debugging class loading problems in
			web containers and application servers that typically have
			sophisticated ClassLoader hierarchies.</p>
			
			<p>Java developers tend to think of their code as belonging to
			packages, but that isn't the entire picture.  Every Java 
			Class object contains a reference to the ClassLoader that 
			defined it.  You can think of a ClassLoader as namespace for 
			a Class, not just it's package.  In fact, instances of
			the exact same Java class loaded by different ClassLoaders are 
			considered totally different by the Java virtual machine.</p>
			
			Here are some examples of the api in action - please refer to 
			the <a href="api/index.html">javadoc</a> for more detail.
			
			<p>The following snippet of code shows how simple it is 
			to figure out where a particular classloader is loading
			a particular class from:</p>
			<pre class="java">
System.out.println( 
    org.theshoemakers.which4j.Which4J.which( java.lang.String.class ) );
			</pre>
			<p>And here is the output:</p>
			<pre class="console">
jar:file:/D:/jdk1.4.1_03/jre/lib/rt.jar!/java/lang/String.class
			</pre>
			
			<p>Which4J allows you to search based on Class instances in 
			addition to class names (although this isn't the preferred
			usage).  It correctly handles Class objects for Java primitives, 
			primitive and non-primitive array types, and the void type:</p>
			
			<pre class="java">
System.out.println( Which4J.which( java.lang.String.class ) );
System.out.println( Which4J.which( Which4J.class ) );
System.out.println( Which4J.which( int.class ) );
System.out.println( Which4J.which( (new Object[3]).getClass() ) );
System.out.println( Which4J.which( (new int[3][4][5][6][7][8][9]).getClass() ) );
System.out.println( Which4J.which( (new Which4J[3]).getClass() ) );
System.out.println( Which4J.which( "java.lang.String" ) ); // not as good as specifying a Class object
            </pre>
            
            <p>Output will vary depending on your classpath and the version
            of J2SE you are running, but here is a sample of what you might see:</p>
            
            <pre class="console">
jar:file:/D:/j2sdk1.4.2_01/jre/lib/rt.jar!/java/lang/String.class
jar:file:/d:/which4j-0.2/lib/which4j.jar!/org/theshoemakers/which4j/Which4J.class
'int' primitive
jar:file:/D:/j2sdk1.4.2_01/jre/lib/rt.jar!/java/lang/Object.class
'int' primitive
jar:file:/d:/which4j-0.2/lib/which4j.jar!/org/theshoemakers/which4j/Which4J.class            			
jar:file:/D:/j2sdk1.4.2_01/jre/lib/rt.jar!/java/lang/String.class
		    </pre>

			<h3>Command line instructions</h3>
			<p>Using Which4J from the command line is easy.  Simply add which4j.jar to
			your classpath and run "java org.theshoemakers.which4j.Which4J".  This application was originally written
			to debug a problem I was having with my shell CLASSPATH environment.
			It was eventually extended to handle the more useful case of searching
			a ClassLoader.  In any event, the command line version has some value,
			but in general, it is better to use the programmatic API's.<p>
			
			<p>On to the samples:</p>

			<p>Here we see the usage message:</p>			
			<pre class="console">
$ java org.theshoemakers.which4j.Which4J -help
usage: java Which4J [-debug] &lt;classname>

        The commandline version of Which4J will search the system
        classpath defined in your environment for all occurrences
        of the class.  Alternatively, you can use this class
        programmatically to search the current (or any) ClassLoader.
        See the javadoc for more detail.



        Note: if the name of the jar file listed after "found in:"
        doesn't match the name of the jar listed next to "url:", then
        there is likely a "Class-Path" entry in the jar manifest
        that is causing the classloader to indirectly find the class.
			</pre>
			
			<p>In this example, we are using Which4J to find itself:</p>
			<pre class="console">
$ java org.theshoemakers.which4j.Which4J org.theshoemakers.which4j.Which4J
found in: d:/which4j-0.2/lib/which4j.jar
     url: jar:file:/d:/which4j-0.2/lib/which4j.jar!/org/theshoemakers/which4j/Which4J.class
			</pre>

		<h2>Building</h2>
		<p>Simply grab a copy of the cvs module from the 
		<a href="https://which4j.dev.java.net/">Which4J homepage</a>
		on java.net, cd into the root directory and launch ant.  The
		build transcript should look something like this:
		
		<pre class="console">
$ ant
Buildfile: build.xml
